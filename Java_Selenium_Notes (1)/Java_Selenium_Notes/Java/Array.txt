Array :

        	Storing A Multiple values in a single variable.

	It is a non-primitive datatype.

Syntax :

DataType variableName [] = new DataType [length];

Eg :		
int a [] = new int [3];

[3] ----> We Give Length

length : 1 2 3 
index :   0 1 2

features :

It Supports Similiar Datatype.

It is Index Based.

index Starts From 0 to n-1 

where n = Length


Dis Advantages :

It Will Support Similiar DataType.

It Has Fixed Length.

It Has High Memory Wastage ....

But It can be Overcome By Collection.


Notes :

If we not initialize the value the default value of the given datatype will be printed.

If we override the index the last value will be printed.
